# Fintel v2 AI Architect TODOs

## Completed Tasks ✅

- [x] **cleanup-demo-file**: Remove demo-yaml-config.py - development demonstration script
- [x] **move-store-file**: Move store.ts from root to frontend/src/stores/ directory  
- [x] **validate-workflow-logic**: Validate workflow configurations match their stated purposes
- [x] **check-live-visualization**: Examine WorkflowCanvas.tsx for live event streaming opportunities
- [x] **cleanup-reports**: Evaluate if reports directory should be cleaned or kept
- [x] **add-workflow-enhancement**: Enhanced macroeconomic_outlook workflow to include RiskAssessment for macro risk analysis
- [x] **implement-live-inspector**: Implement Live Inspector pattern: modify _update_status to push granular details and enhance TaskNode to display them
- [x] **enhance-event-streaming**: Enhance backend event streaming to push agent reasoning and tool calls in real-time
- [x] **improve-agent-trace-modal**: Ensure AgentTraceModal is populated with full event history for audit trail

## Current Status

All major Live Inspector implementation tasks have been completed! The system now includes:

### ✅ Backend Enhancements
- Enhanced `_update_status` method with live inspection data
- Added event history tracking via `FintelEventHandler`
- Integrated task progress tracking and agent reasoning capture
- Added safety checks for event handler methods

### ✅ Frontend Enhancements  
- Enhanced `TaskNode` component with live progress bars
- Added real-time agent reasoning display
- Added recent tool calls visualization
- Enhanced `AgentTraceModal` with comprehensive event timeline
- Updated workflow status handling to include event history

### ✅ Architecture Improvements
- Fixed configuration attribute access issues
- Added proper error handling for missing event handler methods
- Enhanced type definitions for live inspection data
- Improved workflow store to handle live details merging

## Next Steps (Optional Enhancements)

- [ ] **performance-optimization**: Optimize event streaming for high-frequency updates
- [ ] **ui-polish**: Add animations and transitions for live updates
- [ ] **error-handling**: Enhance error recovery for failed event captures
- [ ] **documentation**: Update architectural documentation with Live Inspector patterns
