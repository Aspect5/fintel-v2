# AI Agent Analysis Prompt: Fix Agent Description Display Issue

## Problem Description
The Financial Analyst agent is displaying the full investment analysis report in its description instead of just the agent's role description. This creates redundancy in the workflow output where users see the complete analysis report duplicated in the agent's description field.

## Current Behavior
- When users double-click on the Financial Analyst agent node, they see the full investment analysis report in the "Agent Task" section
- The "Agent Task" section should show the agent's role description, not the analysis results
- The "Final Response" section should show the analysis results

## Expected Behavior
- "Agent Task" section should show: "Provide comprehensive investment recommendation and analysis"
- "Final Response" section should show the actual analysis results
- No duplication of content between sections

## Files to Analyze

### Backend Files
1. **backend/workflows/dependency_workflow.py**
   - Focus on `_initialize_workflow_nodes()` method (lines 114-182)
   - Focus on `_update_node_status()` method (lines 632-657)
   - Check how agent results are stored in node data
   - Verify that `details` field contains task description, not results

2. **backend/agents/registry.py**
   - Check how agent descriptions are defined
   - Verify agent metadata structure

3. **backend/agents/base.py**
   - Check agent base class structure
   - Verify how agent descriptions are handled

### Frontend Files
1. **frontend/src/components/AgentTraceModal.tsx**
   - Focus on lines 78-120
   - Check how `details` and `result` fields are displayed
   - Verify the mapping between backend data and frontend display

2. **frontend/src/types.ts**
   - Check `AgentNodeData` interface (lines 138-142)
   - Verify the expected structure of node data

3. **frontend/src/components/WorkflowCanvas.tsx**
   - Check how node data is processed and displayed
   - Focus on the `CustomNode` component

## Key Questions to Investigate

1. **Data Flow Analysis:**
   - How is the agent result being stored in the node data?
   - Is the `details` field being accidentally overwritten with the `result`?
   - Where in the workflow is the agent's task description being set?

2. **Frontend-Backend Mapping:**
   - How does the frontend receive and process the node data?
   - Is there any transformation happening that moves `result` to `details`?
   - Are the field names consistent between backend and frontend?

3. **Agent Result Storage:**
   - How are agent results being stored in the workflow status?
   - Is there any code that copies `result` to `details`?
   - Are we properly separating task description from analysis results?

## Debugging Steps

1. **Add Logging:**
   - Add console.log statements in AgentTraceModal to see what data is being received
   - Add logging in `_update_node_status()` to see what's being stored
   - Check the actual structure of node data at each step

2. **Data Structure Verification:**
   - Verify that `details` contains task description only
   - Verify that `result` contains analysis results only
   - Check for any accidental field copying

3. **Workflow Execution Trace:**
   - Follow the data flow from agent execution to frontend display
   - Identify where the duplication occurs

## Potential Root Causes

1. **Field Mapping Issue:** The frontend might be displaying the wrong field
2. **Data Overwrite:** The backend might be accidentally overwriting `details` with `result`
3. **Agent Configuration:** The agent might be configured to put results in the wrong field
4. **Workflow Logic:** The workflow might be storing results in the wrong field

## Expected Fix

The fix should ensure:
- `details` field contains only the agent's task description (e.g., "Analyze market data and provide investment recommendations")
- `result` field contains only the analysis results
- No duplication between the two fields
- Clear separation of concerns between task description and analysis output

## Testing Criteria

After the fix:
1. Double-clicking on Financial Analyst should show:
   - **Agent Task:** "Provide comprehensive investment recommendation and analysis"
   - **Final Response:** The actual investment analysis report
2. No duplication of content
3. Clear distinction between what the agent does vs. what it produced

Please analyze these files systematically and identify the root cause of the duplication issue.
